                        <h2>WHAT IS A SPACE TECHNOLOGY?</h2>
                        <h3>
                            Space technology is technology for use in outer
                            space, in travel (astronautics) or other activities
                            beyond Earth's atmosphere, for purposes such as
                            spaceflight, space exploration, and Earth
                            observation. Space technology includes space
                            vehicles such as spacecraft, satellites, space
                            stations and orbital launch vehicles; deep-space
                            communication; in-space propulsion; and a wide
                            variety of other technologies including support
                            infrastructure equipment, and procedures. Many
                            common everyday services for terrestrial use such as
                            weather forecasting, remote sensing, satellite
                            navigation systems, satellite television, and some
                            long-distance communications systems critically rely
                            on space infrastructure. Of the sciences, astronomy
                            and Earth science benefit from space technology.[1]
                            New technologies originating with or accelerated by
                            space-related endeavors are often subsequently
                            exploited in other economic activities.

                            History of space technology See also: Astronautics
                            The first country on Earth to put any technology
                            into space was Soviet Union, formally known as the
                            "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics" (USSR). The
                            USSR sent the Sputnik 1 satellite on October 4,
                            1957. It weighed about 83 kg (183 lb), and is
                            believed to have orbited around the globe. Analysis
                            of the radio signals was used to gather information
                            about the electron density of the ionosphere, while
                            temperature and pressure data was encoded in the
                            duration of radio beeps. The first probe to impact
                            the surface of the Moon was the Soviet probe Luna 2,
                            which made a hard landing on September 14, 1959. The
                            far side of the Moon was first photographed on
                            October 7, 1959, by the Soviet probe Luna 3.s On
                            December 24, 1968, the crew of Apollo 8, Frank
                            Borman, James Lovell and William Anders, became the
                            first human beings to enter lunar orbit and see the
                            far side of the Moon in person. Humans first landed
                            on the Moon on July 20, 1969. The first human to
                            walk on the lunar surface was Neil Armstrong,
                            commander of Apollo 11. Apollo 11 was followed by
                            Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Apollo 13 had a
                            failure of the Apollo service module, but passed the
                            far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254
                            kilometers (158 miles; 137 nautical miles) above the
                            lunar surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from
                            Earth, marking the record for the farthest humans
                            traveled from Earth in 1970. The first robotic lunar
                            rover to land on the Moon was the Soviet vessel
                            Lunokhod 1 on November 17, 1970, as part of the
                            Lunokhod program. To date, the last human to stand
                            on the Moon was Eugene Cernan, who as part of the
                            Apollo 17 mission, walked on the Moon in December
                            1972. Apollo 17 was followed by several uncrewed
                            interplanetary missions operated by NASA. One of the
                            notable interplanetary missions is Voyager 1, the
                            first artificial object to leave the Solar System
                            into interstellar space on August 25, 2012. It is
                            also the most distant artificial object from
                            Earth.[4] The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU
                            to enter interstellar space.[5] Voyager 1 is
                            currently at a distance of 145.11 astronomical units
                            (2.1708×1010 km; 1.3489×1010 mi) (21.708 billion
                            kilometers; 13.489 billion miles) from Earth as of
                            January 1, 2019.[6]
